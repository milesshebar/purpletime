PurpleTime is a webapp that provides riders of Knox Area Transit's Purple Line with the realtime location of the shuttle, when it is running.

It was originally created for my senior capstone in Scientific Computing at Kenyon College in Gambier, OH. It uses express, socket.io, leaflet, xml2js, and moment.js.

Due to the untimely arrival of COVID-19, the project has not yet been realized in full. I had intended for a large part of the project to consist of promoting and launching the app in the Mount Vernon and Gambier communities, in coordination with KAT. I also planned to expand the project to every KAT line. But the app works, and the groundwork is all there.

**If you are a current Kenyon student or community member, and are interested in taking over as the maintainer of this project, please get in touch with me.**
